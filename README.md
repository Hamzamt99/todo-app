## Describe how global state is consumed by the components:
### Global state is typically consumed by components in a software system through explicit references or access methods provided by the state management system. Components request and receive the current state values they need from the global state store, ensuring synchronization and consistency across the application. Any updates to the global state are also managed and propagated through the same system, ensuring all components are aware of changes.

## Describe the operation of the hook: useForm():
Initialization: When you call useForm(), it initializes and returns an object that holds the state and methods necessary for handling forms. This object typically includes properties like form values, validation functions, and event handlers.

Form Values: The useForm() hook provides a way to manage and access the values of form fields, such as text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. It keeps track of the current state of these form fields.

Event Handlers: The hook usually includes event handlers (e.g., onChange for input fields) that you can attach to your form elements. These handlers update the form's internal state as the user interacts with the form.

Validation: It often offers built-in validation functions or allows you to define custom validation logic for form fields. These validation functions help ensure that the user's input meets specified criteria.

Submission: useForm() usually provides a way to handle form submission. It can include a method or function that gathers the form data and sends it to a server or performs other actions, like displaying validation errors.

Form State: The hook manages the overall state of the form, including whether it has been touched, whether there are validation errors, and whether it has been successfully submitted.

Reset: Many implementations of useForm() provide a way to reset the form to its initial state, clearing any user input and validation errors.

Integration with Form Elements: You typically integrate the useForm() hook with your form elements by binding the provided event handlers and values to the corresponding form elements, ensuring that they stay in sync.
